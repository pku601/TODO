crown prince hassan even recently august king issue statement whilst abroad dismiss rumor replacement nonsense therefore surprise removal crown prince hassan come shock many people jordan elsewhere assure someone follow jordanian affairs long time believe going happen happen would base analysis entirely words king either speak cnn interview write letter crown prince hassan rather kind rumor first question hassans wield authority kings absence clearly issue interpretation crown prince hassan aware jordan elsewhere saying years perhaps hassan simply cut king think hassan saw last six month opportunity establish assert authority show could king right apparently consult king much expect especially sensitive issue army whole question replacement chief staff believe hassans intention undermine king probably king hussein understand second factor rift concern succession issue initially hassans place would follow hassan kings son hamza hassans son rashid hassan obviously prefer follow son king make clear letter brother repeatedly refuse commit agreement succession become king tension two family gossiping backbite subsequent deterioration relationship two men also put forward reason kings decision recently hussein realize life coming end choice make quick decisive decision taking account perhaps factor also come arabic press personally know whether true usa arguing replacing hassan would right thing repute unsuitability decision therefore could delay decision finally make appropriate shock effect jordanian publics sense stable continuity jordanian felt great advantage comparison many arab state knew would next always source comfort even reservation hassan know person highly respect intellect experience international reputation given chance could one day prove great king initial shock people seem getting use idea abdallah follow father respect hassans graceful majestic acceptance removal great importance would exclude possibility later interest dynasty jordan hassan accept fate due course help abdallah much say abdallahs family origin fact mother english quite honestly think consequence toni gardener indeed english convert islam marry king hussein therefore abdallah born two moslem parent talking regime base primogeniture meaning origin wife crucial husseins standing never affect married english woman marry american wife christian one arab parent one want pick choose hamza son hussein noor come better parent abdallah king hussein marry toni gardener also abdallah born become crown prince remain hassan reach age fact abdallah pass

officer general commander special force extremely important country stability backbone regime neither hassan hamza compare favorably abdallah terms relationship security establishment know little abdallah political person limelight many years say far character much like father terms intelligence personal charm nevertheless lack political experience major part analysis jordans stability

senior experience politician jordan addition family many prince today unlike husseins time capable coaching abdallah transition abdallah certainly main asset loyalty arm force addition continuity external interest remains great ever regard countrys domestic security unlikely jordan rule characterize cohesiveness face subversion facing real threat possible opponent exist would say follow

lose right travel open factory going keep quiet put faith time anyway yet unproven ability prince abdallah palestinian occupy territory palestinian occupy territory matter serious last years final status issue carefully study crown prince hassan suddenly without warning longer information analysis might vanish guarantee transfer abdallah follow line going start zero point one leaders palestinian opposition tell last week arafat smart enough immediately amman say on may announce palestinian state may declare confederation laugh tell king interest get involve palestinian mess arafat put eggs unfamiliar jordanian hand realize know little abdallah intention abdallahs men advisor agenda palestinian leadership rather tricky situation things somewhat different regard palestinian elite palestinian businessmen see opportunity strengthen tie jordanian unite state concern position unite state statement support new change address jordanian telling back stability regime add supplement wye memorandum given another million prepare give help jordanian economy clear message design build trust confidence amongst jordanian believe nothing bad happen long backing support know without strong economy stability jordan european country come know crown prince hassan well accept future king course abide kings decision army political elite agree change loyalty consider kings word law israel netanyahu call meeting security apparatus discus future jordan one wonder hide agenda abdallah bearing mind interest seeing transition phase accomplish arafat partner refuse recognize palestinian state going back old likud thesis accord palestinian home jordan netanyahu reelect partner peace dangerous accord point view also accord point view many israeli circle threat jordan palestinian continue right wing israel discussion prof susser start netanyahu hide agenda israeli say netanyahu dangerous mean dangerous israel jordanpalestine agenda true likud agenda one put

whether want put end idea whole logic likud change prepeace formula likud judge context making big mistake sharon spokesman jordanpalestine yet today believe favor interlocutor jordanian side river simply change mind whole thing deliver israel already withdraw territory commit withdraw area whole idea greater israel window everybody know make sense israeli interest jordanian stability israel enter final status negotiation palestinian fact israel always interest jordanian stability israels interest palestinian establish state threat israel jordan player hide agenda palestinian example iraqi praise husseins decision bringing stuff abdallahs mother typical iraqi government agenda arafat agree abdul hadi impossible palestinian keep quiet refugee want talk refugee jordanian citizen face problem jordanian government abdul hadi palestinian likud saying bank bank prof susser moment hope future saying understand one hand palestinian like others hide agenda hand saying need jordanian suspect palestinian hide agenda abdul hadi correct wrong secular palestinian opposition pflp example well palestinian religious opposition hamas islamic jihad interest today idea confederation jordan arafat hand amman emptyhanded jordan king hussein new chapter starting point reason call confederation political cart face israeli confidence cart palestinian jordan cart new jordanian elite establish antipalestinian position prof susser dont know believe jordanian would accept idea confederation without knowing exactly kind palestinian state establish commit unknown palestinian entity regard holliss viewpoint concern unfairness happen hassan agree completely take kings place past six month thought good job punish ask well perhaps punish things hollis mention example going take jordan new era establish new kind political order sort things perhaps many jordan really interest maybe jordanian monarchy kind antiquate rule criticize something jordanian decide arab world country iraq desperate create monarchy saddam desperate son succeed assad means far great revolutionary concern future lie monarchy hollis saying pity jordan shouldnt become democracy interest make convince case stability jordan depend pillar little jargon modernize state prof susser think jordanian finding choose jargon jordan chosen jordan would repeat personality king factor jordan king virtually unfit govern make difference jordan survive replace hussein hassans chemistry army rather lack chemistry however make difference king chemistry power structure problem general discussion question fact people democracy real election miss pillar could contribute destabilization jordan prof susser regard election make comparison scandinavian country neighbor country past jordanian look abdul nasser savior change today look find much better neighbor jordan liberal decent stable fair regime sometimes treat opposition ruthlessly like iraq saudi arabia unrealistic expect jordan become total democracy palestinian jordan ask whether would choose live monarchy arafats leadership would choose monarchy comment also consider fact king hussein play major role move peace process forward abdallah still long way able play similar role prof susser take long time abdallah become hussein even totally fill space hassan might able either sure however abdallah work hard fill gap question hearing reason hassan might good successor prof susser answer question analyst make mistake time believe king want hassan beginning even hassan extremely surprise decision question much influence unite state kings decision could queen noor try secure power son hamza prof susser great believer conspiracy theory perhaps something alwatan alarabi publish something along line many people spoke hassans unsuitability years perhaps idea hassan going restructure country decisive factor question wonder king name abdallah successor soon sent letter hassan prof susser think king know going come back various reason perhaps simply feeling unwell unable things quickly want choose delay announcement question long monarchy going last role hassan play future prof susser know hashemite monarchy overthrow iraq many people though days king jordan number monarch still much regard hassans role try introduce new pattern political behavior jordan perhaps cost throne jordanian constitution place prominence political party free press free organization etc liberal constitution one undoubtedly base monarchy jordans monarchy never democratize completely rule set king democratization top question
