delay wait get actually get proceedings since proceedings dont yet seem online find good talks see yes know promise another post interim doesnt really count mind post hal comment links post label conference june old school conference blogging days conference blog come fairly accept part academic blogger repertoire ive actually receive email third day conference people know attending asking havent blogged yet colleague blog share similar story world manage without occasionally like read old papers like late early mostly stats occasionally nlp mostly fun often learn things old nlp paper typically amuse anything else bit relief see set things consider interest important years ago browsing acl proceedings wont share answer old anthology come across paper title parse thought quite impressive someone would audacious enough title paper parse mean imagine going talk acl seeing title machine translation absurd read paper well turn really research paper acls parse area chair impression parse papers year relate previous year fantastic thought like prewebera conference blog random guy blogging favorite acl papers across variety area rather one person probably know parse papers acl year better anyone area chair know summarization submission know quite well accept submission least right issue acceptreject notification sat right write page summary relate past year probably would take two hours average blog post take min figure would want diligent also sure look happen year would actually love see something like reinstate think capture important area thats miss standard conference blog namely get coverage age attend fewer fewer talks conference blog post necessarily really spotty chair every area write one page summary think would great really dont think much add effort easily spend times going review looking inconsistency reading papers etc however think useful also dont think really something need proceedings going try start trend every time area chair conference post blog summary papers area ever area chair would like participate please contact perhaps ill one ever hope ill start acl summarization next post post hal comment links post label community conference june evaluate topic model think fair say fan bayesian lifestyle least handful papers bayesian title mislead use bayes rule noisychannel model sense probably also fair say fan nlp let think fan bayes fan nlp must topic modeling ldastyle model right well really admittedly something look like topic modeling queryfocused summarization never really topic modeling topic modeling sake main reason stay away ruthless yet endlessly malleable world topic modeling notoriously difficult evaluate get away summarization example could evaluate summary directly purpose post discus one try evaluate topic model end day topic model probabilistic model document although sometimes model collection document simple example let take lda particular case lda first two dirichlet last two multinomial indicator select mixture simplicity though let collapse hyperparameters single variable true parameter single parameter treat let assume conjugate life would easy want evaluate model want check see really good model document precisely better model document whatever comparing perhaps ive propose new version claim lifelike well natural thing would take heldout data evaluate accord model whichever model assign higher probability heldout data probably better point need take moment talk inference there whole monte carlo camp there whole deterministic variational laplace etc camp give something totally different monte carlo camp well typically get set many possibly weight sample joint distribution pazw easily throw component arrive conditional distribution whatever parameter want deterministic camp one standard things might get typeii maximum likelihood estimate given training data value maximize paw empirical bayes route deterministic approximation allow fully bayes integrate well back evaluation issue come order evaluate order compute inference particular marginalize heldout data camp would mean taking sample describe posterior distribution given marginalize using posterior evaluate heldout likelihood would involve another run sampler marginalize new data deterministic camp may mlii point estimate hyperparameters still need marginalize usually means basically running inference running test data quite unfortunate case rerun sampler rerun going computationally expensive life probably slightly better deterministic camp usually get fairly reasonable approximation evidence camp life pretty bad run sampler usually going pretty high variance even worse plain hard evaluate evidence sampler least dont know really good ways ive look reasonably extensively though corrections naivete certainly welcome recourse one reasonable standard thing hold data different way instance instead holding document ill hold words document advantage since parameter typically documentspecific obtain every document process normal inference means least part integration computing pwa disappear usually tractable problem approach many case really line want evaluate typically want evaluate well model model totally new document parts previously see document issue though irksome topicmodeling setting another standard thing throw latent variable sort classification problem take newsgroups data set training test combine run topic model get documentlevel parameter use parameter say logistic regression see well definitely get around test new data problem really cheating mind give estimate problem estimate cloak behind classification maybe there natural classification task associate data maybe classification wash precisely distinction model try capture final method want talk learn wei andrew mccallum briefly describe pachinko allocation paper though recall andrew telling technique stemslike many thingsfrom stats namely empirical likelihood estimate diggle gratton key idea empirical likelihood replace statistically simple computationally complex model statistically complex computationally simple model evaluate likelihood accord instead here think let say whatever inference training data allow obtain method sampling distribution pwa case well mlii estimate follow topic model generative story sample use sample easy enough going generate ton faux document posterior document estimate simple model instance might simply estimate multinomial bag words faux document consider giant mixture multinomial evenly weight number mixture component number faux document generate nice thing evaluate likelihood test data mixture multinomial really easy take test document compute average likelihood faux multinomial voila method course without issue one multinomial might good model use instance topic model say anything word order might want estimate simple gram language model instead estimate might also high variance many faux document need sort kernel smooth help introduce additional bias havent see anyone evaluation topicmodel things would nice see overall find method least offensive ringing praise fact implement part hbc

133	0	unbenanntes dokument startseite daugavpils mittwoch september geschichte und gegenwart lettlands von latgale betrachtet unser seminar universität daugavpils vorbemerkung verena dohrn auf dem marktplatz von rezekne steht ein mahnmal sowjetzeit das die erschießung einwohner des altgläubigendorfes audrene jahre durch die deutsche okkupationsmacht erinnert ihnen wurde kollaboration mit feindlichen sowjetarmee unterstellt von charlotte mönch nach politischen haltung altgläubigen grenzregion während naziokkupation befragt hielt sich regionalhistoriker vladimirs nikonovs zurück mit bemerkung die quellen müssten neu gelesen und differenziert gedeutet werden forschungen über die geschichte und die kollektive identität altgläubigen baltikum haben erst unlängst begonnen viele historiker sprechen von ihnen als einer ethnokonfessionellen gruppe deren verhältnis russland infolge immer wieder aufflammenden verfolgungen durch die orthodoxe kirche und den staat und aufgrund von jahrhunderte lang währender nichtanerkennung und marginalisierung kompliziert ist regel haben sich die altgläubigen zumeist offizielle fragebögen als „altgläubige“ und nicht als „russen“ eingetragen die forschungen des französischen kollegen yvan leclère ergaben das sich das verhältnis altgläubigen latgale zur staatsmacht mit reformpolitik zar alexander zum besseren wenden begann ihnen land verschaffte und manche vorteile brachte jener zeit begannen sie sich kulturell und politisch mit russland identifizieren doch die russische revolution und die machtübernahme bolševiki rissen erneut eine tiefe kluft zwischen die altgläubigen und russland die politische situation latgales zweiten weltkrieg brachte die altgläubigen grenzregion erneut eine außerordentlich schwierige lage die gegner – die deutsche wehrmacht und die sowjetarmee – verlangten beide von ihnen loyalität ein indiz dafür das sich manche altgläubige dieser russen und russland zugehörig fühlten ist eine grabstätte für unbekannte russische soldaten auf dem friedhof orthodoxen ioannkirche maza kalna moskauer vorstadt die bei einnahme riga durch die deutsche wehrmacht sommer getötet und – wie auf den grabsteinen steht – von altgläubigen anwohnern begraben wurden vortrag zum thema die altgläubigen und ihr verhältnis russland während deutschen okkupation zweiten weltkrieg die russen des östlichen lettland während naziokkupation von dmitrijs olechnovics übersetzt und gekürzt von verena dohrn eine besonders engagiert diskutierte frage historiographie ist die periode naziokkupation lettlands die politische umerziehung machte notwendig sich fragen zuzuwenden die scheinbar schon erforscht waren eine von ihnen ist die nationale politik nazi auf dem okkupierten territorium lettlands von anfang errichteten die nazi eine „neue ordnung“ auf dem okkupierten territorium lettlands denn war für die okkupationsmacht strategisch wichtig gute beziehungen zur bevölkerung entwickeln und nutzen die protesthaltung wie den widerstand hinter kampflinie deutschen armee einzudämmen die wurde eine grundlegenden aufgaben presse denn sie war die einflussreichste informationsquelle politischen propaganda auf dem okkupierten territorium wurden die bereits erprobten methoden den regionalen verhältnissen angepasst die propaganda zeigte die soldaten des dritten reich geführt von hitler als symbol des kampfes gegen die „dunklen mächte“ jedem wurde seine rolle zugewiesen – wehrmachtssoldat mit waffe den händen kämpft für ein neues europa und die bevölkerung des okkupierten territoriums hilft ihm dabei mit allen kräften letztendlich sollte die propaganda alle von Überlegenheit und wahrheit ideologie des nationalsozialismus überzeugen von den nazi okkupierten lettland war haupttrick politischen propaganda ein feindbild schaffen und auszubeuten die beschreibung des „schrecklichen jahres“ gemeint war das jahr sowjetischen besetzung und die hyperbolisierte interpretation fakten geschichte lettlands dabei die besondere akzentuierung themen des blutigen terror und verschwörung gegen das lettische volk und später gegen das russische wurden das schlüsselmoment propaganda die auf dem territorium lettlands herausgegebenen zeitungen lettischer russischer und später auch lettgallischer sprache zeichneten unaufhörlich ein bild dunklen vergangenheit und einer erwartenden hellen zukunft die dank mutigen leitung des führers möglich wurde anfangsphase okkupation lettlands wurden mehr als dreißig presseorgane lettischer sprache herausgegeben und nur mit veränderung lage auf den schlachtfeldern und verstärkung des protest unter ansässigen bevölkerung winter kam presse russischer sprache auf februar wurde eine vertrauliche mitteilung propagandaabteilung des generalkommissariats riga herausgegeben man daraufhin das „ gebrauch des wortes ’sowjetrussland’ ’sowjetische russen’ oder ’russland’ und ’russen’ falsch ist allen fällen soll von ’sowjetunion’ oder von ’bolševiki’ gesprochen werden“ dabei wurden die versuche okkupationsmacht mit den vorstehern russischen gemeinden latgales anzubändeln nicht verborgen „ hier und heute stattfindende kampf mit den bolševiki das ist ein großartiger kreuzzug gesamten kulturmenschheit gegen die kräfte zerstörung und des bösen die von dem internationalen jüdischen kahal gefüttert und genährt werden und das russische volk den abgrund unerhörter leiden und opfer gerissen haben die zerstörung dieser finsteren kräfte für das glück gesamten menschheit und erster linie für die befreiung des russischen volkes ist eine heilige mission adolf hitler “ „dvinskij vestnik“ vom april das okkupationskommando verstand sehr gut das ein bedeutender teil russischen bevölkerung sich außerhalb kontrolle nazipropaganda befand und das viele über lange zeit sowjetische propagandamaterialien aufbewahrten die bedeutendste zeitung war „dvinskij vestnik“ sie kostete pfennig wenig war geringste stundenlohn für einen arbeiter betrug derzeit reichspfennige und auch das fehlen anderer informationsquellen machte sie außerordentlich populär unter russischen bevölkerung nicht nur ostlettland sondern auch riga verantwortliche redakteur albert zembergs arbeitete seit beginn okkupation mit den okkupationsverbänden zusammen die aufsicht über die publikation erheblich erleichterte das das genannte presseorgan wie die mehrheit anderen zeitungen erst nach seinem erscheinen zensiert wurde das schema nach dem die materialien quelle veröffentlicht wurden entsprach dem anderen publikationsorgane jener zeit die erste rubrik war den ereignismeldungen von ostfront gewidmet zweiten wurden grundsätzlich propagandaartikel untergebracht und dritten offizielle mitteilungen lokale und regionale neuigkeiten die vierte rubrik bot regel unterhaltung mit einem scharfen propagandistischen unterton die zeitung besaß eine klare ausrichtung auf den russischen leser artikel über die partisanen gab mehr als den veröffentlichungen lettischer sprache sie sind breiter angelegt und detaillierter das sagt indirekt etwas darüber das gerade die russische bevölkerung die hauptstütze partisanen war „ monat november wurden von den bolševiki sabotagebanden den dörfern janciški und zelenovka ausgesetzt die bauern haben sie monatelang unterstützt und versteckt die schuldigen bauern und osin grigor’ev zelenovka wurden auf meinen befehl hin öffentlich erhängt den bauern fotij anisimov zelenovka sich ebenfalls derselben sache schuldig gemacht hat habe ich begnadigt letzten moment zur kommandantur kam und durch ihn ein flüchtiges mitglied dieser bande entdeckt wurde“ „dvinskij vestnik“ vom mai einer gründe für die unterstützung partisanen war scheinbar das die russen die sowjetischen einheiten hinter front als ihre eigenen leute ansahen die propagandisten versuchten die bevölkerung dazu bringen die hilfeleistungen für die partisanen einzustellen „was ist das partisanentum das ist diebstahl helllichten tage die … partisanen bedeuten ein schreckliches elend für den bauern und erst recht für den armut gebrachten und von den verbrecherischen bolschewistischen armeen bestohlenen diese banden können nur durch diebstahl existieren und dabei wälzen sie die verantwortung für ihr verbrecherisches und sinnloses handeln auf die unglückliche bevölkerung die bauern terrorisierend stürzen die räuber ganze dörfer nach den gesetzen des krieges ins verderben die bauern werden unter todesangst zur abgabe ihres letzten besitzes gezwungen und haben sie ihn hergegeben werden sie von deutschen kommandantur zur verantwortung gezogen diese schreckliche geißel sollte vor ort von den bauern selbst liquidiert werden … sowjetische partisanen verteidigen können nur überzeugte verbrecher die nichts auf das wohl des volkes und seine interessen geben die sache bauernschaft ist sich vor dem schrecklichen bösen acht nehmen vor den räuberischen partisanen“ „dvinskij vestnik“ vom september die nazipropagandisten registrierten das gerücht das kirchen errichtet würden mit besonderer aufmerksamkeit vor allem weil die sowjetmacht sich erster linie als „gottlos“ darstellte diesem fall ist die folgende karikatur aussagekräftig die hauptfeinde des russischen volkes waren nach ansicht zeitungen stalin und seine jüdischen helfershelfer gpu aber nicht die sowjetmacht als ganze obgleich auch sie als das absolut böse erschien besonders wenn sie mit stalin identifiziert wurde die artikel durchgesehenen quelle stellen etwas Ähnliches wie die mittelalterlichen exempla vor ihre aufnahme durch ein breites publikum erleichterte die nationalsozialistische propagandamaschine war darauf bei ansässigen bevölkerung ein feindbild schaffen und sie zugleich zur kollaboration mit den okkupationstruppen bewegen gleichwohl scheint den propagandisten großen maßstab nicht gelungen sein die realisieren vortrag zum thema geschichte und gedächtnis russischen minderheiten lettland von prof irena saleniece protokolliert von diana krastina und david sittler wurde stelle das erste bethaus altgläubigen migranten baltikum gebaut worden ist ein schwarzes kreuz als gedenkstätte errichtet damit wird dieser teil lettischen geschichte aktuellen erinnerungskultur aufgewertet die ist gerade deshalb interessant weil sich die minderheitenstatistiken laufe des und jahrhunderts stark verändert haben von stieg bevölkerungsanteil russen lettland von auf über damit waren russen lettland kaum mehr als minderheit betrachten dieser prozess wurde aber bereits durch das gesetz von zur schulautonomie begünstigt ein weiteres gesetz sicherte allen konfessionen das begehen ihrer feiertage die gezielte ausbildungsförderung minderheiten von staatlicher seite war teil ihrer stärkeren kulturellen beachtung ersten republik die finanzierung wurde von eigen dafür eingerichteten abteilungen den ministerien organisiert die altgläubigen passten sich daher den jahren nicht nur stärker sondern herrschte auch auf grund gemeinsamer interessen eine aktive kooperation zwischen den altgläubigen und ihrem gesellschaftlichen umfeld einer neubewertung und bearbeitung des minderheitenbegriffs kam zwangsläufig nach eingliederung lettlands das sowjetische herrschaftsgebiet jahr dann deutschen besatzung und schließlich nach unabhängigkeit lettlands saleniece gewann bei ihrer arbeit den eindruck das russische und lettische zeitgenossen etwa gleichen alter die geschichte seit und die okkupation lettlands ziemlich ähnlich erlebt hätten die individuellen unterschiede erschienen ihr den interview wichtiger als die ethnischreligiösen diesen eindruck konnten die befragungen von sowjetbürgern die nach eingewandert sind nicht untermauern sie natürlich keine erinnerung die zeit ersten republik haben zugespitzt lautet daher die salenieces „es gibt keine speziell russische „erinnerungsvariante“ russkaja versija latvii erlebten geschichte lettlands“ verena bezweifelte die über die identität erinnerungen von minderheit und mehrheit während jahre ebenso wie sowjetzeit aufgrund von Übersetzungs und zeitproblemen gelang keine explizite beantwortung anschließenden kleinen gesprächsrunde mit saleniece und ein paar ihrer studenten wurde auf die oralhistoryinterviews eingegangen die saleniece und ihre studierenden durchführen dabei interessieren sie sich für fragen alltags regional bildungs und
